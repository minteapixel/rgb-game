## RGB Color Game

This is an interactive color game app which involves DOM manipulation with the use of vanilla JS and CSS/HTML. I included _additional features_ to further my coding skills.

#### Additional Features:
- __Flexbox CSS__ - included so that the game would render properly on mobile and tablets. 

- __'Infernal' mode__  features 12 colored squares (that's 3 more squares than the 'hard' mode) and all squares have very similar shades of color. See screenshots below.

## Live Demo
